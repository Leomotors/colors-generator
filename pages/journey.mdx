# My Journey

This page is where I store my opinion and approach for this assignment

Back to [Home Page](/)

## Stage 1

The stage 1 is pretty straight-forward, I took approximately an hour
(including _resting_ time)

### The approach - Backend

```ts
export interface IColorDef {
  type: string;
  fields: Record<string, [number, number]>;
}

export type IColorDefs = IColorDef[];
```

I use schema-based generation over hard-coded if-else to make it easily extensible.

## What I learn from this assignment

- Using MDX with Next
  - I try out MDX for the first time to make this journey page
