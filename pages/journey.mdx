# My Journey

This page is where I store my opinion and approach for this assignment

Back to [Home Page](/)

## Stage 1

The stage 1 is pretty straight-forward, I took approximately an hour
(including _resting_ time)

### The approach - Backend

```ts
export interface IColorDef {
  type: string;
  fields: Record<string, [number, number]>;
}

export type IColorDefs = IColorDef[];
```

I use schema-based generation over hard-coded if-else to make it easily extensible.

## Stage 2

The previous version of API use schema-based for backend but not for frontend,
so I modify it and frontend to use schema-based.

This allows the team to easily define their schema and add it to definitions.

In order for team to add new colors (ex: BRGB), they will need to define schema like this:

```ts
{
  type: "brgb",
  fields: {
    red: [0, 10000],
    green: [0, 10000],
    blue: [0, 10000],
  },
  conversion: {
    to: "rgba",
    map: {
      red: { to: "red", range: [0, 255] },
      green: { to: "green", range: [0, 255] },
      blue: { to: "blue", range: [0, 255] },
    },
    default: {
      alpha: 1,
    },
  },
},
```

Because CSS only supports RGB/RGBA and HSL/HSLA all color spaces must have
definition of transforming into these color spaces.

By looking at team requirements of BRGB, I make my schema-based generation
support all kinds of **Linear Map** which mean if the team has BHSL, it will be
very easy to add it. However, if the team needs curved map (like ease-in, polynomial, etc.)
There will be some work needed.

In those case, I will first listen to their scope and try my best to make schema
covers what they want.

## Known Issues

- When clicking "Generate!" for the first time, HSL color will failed to render.
  Spam "Generate!" will fix it.

## Stuff I want to do

These are things I will do next when the team are okay with this idea.

- Error handling
- Fixes Known Issues
